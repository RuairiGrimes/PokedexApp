PokedexApp
----------

#About App
This App is a fun little project built from the Angular framework using Data from the publically available PokeAPI: https://pokeapi.co
The App is my own interpretation on the 'Pokedex' system within Pokemon games. It lists each monster in the game, along with importat information about each - feel free to have a look around.

#Checking out and running the code
* Check out the main branch of the Project and Open it in your IDE/Code editor of choice. Since this is built using Angular and Angular CLI, I reccomend VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com
* Open the Terminal from within your code editor and run the command ng serve
* The web application should launch by default on the port 4200
* Open the Development Server [localhost:](http://localhost:4200/)
* Enjoy!
